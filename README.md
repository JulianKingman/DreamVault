# Dream Journal App

Welcome to the Dream Journal App, a React Native application designed to help you record and explore your dreams. This app provides a simple and intuitive interface for capturing your nocturnal adventures and insights.

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface for recording dreams
- Secure storage of your dream entries
- Ability to categorize and tag dreams
- Search functionality to find specific dreams

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Roadmap

We're constantly working to improve the Dream Journal App. Here are some exciting features we're planning to implement:

1. **Lattice Cryptography**: Enhancing security with post-quantum cryptography techniques. We're exploring implementations similar to those found in [this repository](https://github.com/FuKyuToTo/lattice-based-cryptography?tab=readme-ov-file) and [this repository](https://github.com/antontutoveanu/crystals-kyber-javascript?tab=readme-ov-file).

2. **Sign in with Face ID**: Implementing biometric authentication for enhanced security and ease of access.

3. **Import from Notes**: Allowing users to import dream entries from their device's native Notes app. We'll be leveraging APIs similar to [INSearchForNotebookItemsIntentHandling](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/sirikit/insearchfornotebookitemsintenthandling) for this feature.

4. **Sync on iCloud**: Implementing cloud synchronization to keep your dream journal backed up and accessible across devices. We'll be using the [react-native-cloud-storage](https://github.com/kuatsu/react-native-cloud-storage) library to facilitate this feature.

5. **LLM-based Interpretation**: Exploring the possibility of on-device dream interpretation using Large Language Models (LLMs). This feature's implementation will depend on the capabilities available in iOS 18 and beyond.

Stay tuned for these exciting updates!
